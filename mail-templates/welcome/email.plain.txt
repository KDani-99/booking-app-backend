Hello, {{name}}!

In order to get started you have to first create a table. The tables will be your "groups" to make service packages. Then you will be able to add services to the table.
For example: you make a table called "My car wash's name" and in this table you add a few service packages like "Standard wash", "Super fast wash" and "Luxury wash".
If you have set at least one service to a table, then you will be able to share the table's booking link to your customers or you can check it out too.
Now go and make your customers' lives easier!
